This script uses the random and string modules in Python. It defines a generate_password function that takes an optional argument length (default is 12) to specify the length of the password. The function generates a random password by combining letters (uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation.

To use this script:

Save the code in a Python file (e.g., password_generator.py).
Change the password_length variable to the desired length.
Run the script using Python in your terminal or within Visual Studio Code.
The generated password will be displayed in the output.
You can adjust the password_length variable to create passwords of different lengths. Additionally, modify the characters string to include or exclude specific character sets based on your password requirements (e.g., excluding punctuation or adding special characters).
